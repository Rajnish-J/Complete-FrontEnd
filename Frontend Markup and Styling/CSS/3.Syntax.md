# CSS Syntax and Types of CSS

## Introduction
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of HTML elements. In this guide, we will explore the **syntax of CSS** and the **different types of CSS** that can be used in web development.

## How CSS Works
Before diving into CSS syntax, it's essential to understand how browsers apply CSS. When an HTML page loads, the browser applies default styles to elements. These are known as **User-Agent Styles**, which define the default appearance of elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<button>`.

However, developers override these styles using custom CSS rules, which are written in three ways:
- **Inline CSS** (written inside HTML elements)
- **Internal CSS** (written within `<style>` tags inside the HTML file)
- **External CSS** (written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document)

## CSS Syntax
CSS is composed of **rules**, each consisting of a **selector**, **properties**, and **values**.

### Basic Syntax:
```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

### Example:
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Breakdown:
- **Selector** (`h1`) ‚Äì Specifies which HTML element the styles should apply to.
- **Property** (`color`) ‚Äì Defines the aspect of the element being styled.
- **Value** (`blue`) ‚Äì Specifies the styling applied to the property.
- **Declaration Block** (`{ color: blue; font-size: 24px; }`) ‚Äì Contains the properties and values.

## Types of CSS
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inline CSS
Inline CSS is applied directly within an HTML element using the `style` attribute. It affects only that specific element.

#### Example:
```html
<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Hello World</h1>
```

#### Advantages:
- Easy to apply to individual elements.
- Useful for quick fixes and debugging.

#### Disadvantages:
- Not reusable.
- Makes HTML cluttered.
- Difficult to manage for large projects.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Internal CSS
Internal CSS is written inside a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of the HTML document. It applies styles to the entire document but is limited to that specific file.

#### Example:
```html
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: brown;
      font-size: 24px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

#### Advantages:
- Allows styling multiple elements within the same file.
- Better organization than inline CSS.

#### Disadvantages:
- Not reusable across multiple files.
- Increases page load time if styles are too complex.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ External CSS
External CSS is written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section.

#### Example:
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

#### styles.css:
```css
h1 {
  color: aqua;
  font-size: 30px;
}
```

#### Advantages:
- Keeps HTML clean and separate from styling.
- Reusable across multiple HTML files.
- Enhances maintainability and performance.

#### Disadvantages:
- Requires an additional HTTP request to fetch the CSS file.
- Might not be immediately visible when the HTML file is loaded offline.

## CSS Box Model
The box model consists of four parts:
1. **Content** ‚Äì The actual text or image inside an element.
2. **Padding** ‚Äì Space between content and border.
3. **Border** ‚Äì Surrounds the padding.
4. **Margin** ‚Äì Space outside the border.

### Example:
```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
}
```
