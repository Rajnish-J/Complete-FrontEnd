# JavaScript Execution Context and Call Stack

## **Introduction**
When you run a JavaScript program, several things happen behind the scenes inside the **JavaScript Engine**. The execution process revolves around the **Execution Context** and the **Call Stack**.

## **Execution Context**
The **Execution Context** is a container where JavaScript code is executed. It consists of two phases:

### **1. Memory Creation Phase (Creation Phase)**
- JavaScript **allocates memory** to variables and functions before executing any code.
- Variables are assigned the value `undefined`, while function declarations store the entire function definition.

Example:
```js
var n = 2;
function square(num) {
    var ans = num * num;
    return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```
**Memory Allocation in the First Phase:**
| Variable/Function | Stored Value |
|------------------|-------------|
| `n` | `undefined` |
| `square` | Function Definition |
| `square2` | `undefined` |
| `square4` | `undefined` |

### **2. Code Execution Phase**
- JavaScript **executes code line by line** and updates variable values.
- **Function Invocation** creates a new Execution Context.
- Once a function finishes execution, its Execution Context is **deleted**.

Execution Steps:
1. `n = 2` â†’ Updates `n` value from `undefined` to `2`.
2. `square2 = square(n);` â†’ Calls the function `square(2)`.
   - A new **Execution Context** is created.
   - `num` is assigned `2`.
   - `ans = 2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Returns `4`, which is assigned to `square2`.
3. `square4 = square(4);` â†’ Calls the function `square(4)`.
   - A new **Execution Context** is created.
   - `num` is assigned `4`.
   - `ans = 4 * 4 = 16`.
   - Returns `16`, which is assigned to `square4`.

## **Function Execution and Nested Execution Contexts**
Each time a function is invoked, a **new Execution Context** is created. This follows a pattern:
1. **Create a new Execution Context**
2. **Allocate memory (Memory Creation Phase)**
3. **Execute code (Code Execution Phase)**
4. **Return control to the calling context**
5. **Delete the functionâ€™s Execution Context**

Example of Execution Context creation:
```js
// Global Execution Context is created
var num = 2;
function square(n) {
    var ans = n * n;
    return ans;
}

var square2 = square(num); // New Execution Context for square(2)
var square4 = square(4);   // Another Execution Context for square(4)
```
Each **function call** creates a separate execution context.

## **Call Stack in JavaScript**
JavaScript uses the **Call Stack** to manage function execution. The **Call Stack** follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.

### **How Call Stack Works**
1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is pushed onto the stack.
2. **Function Execution Contexts** are pushed onto the stack when invoked.
3. When a function completes execution, its **Execution Context is popped** from the stack.
4. Once all functions are executed, the **Global Execution Context is removed**, and the stack is empty.

Example:
```js
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

greet(); // Function invocation
console.log("Done");
```
**Call Stack Flow:**
1. `Greet()` is called â†’ **Execution Context for greet() is created and pushed onto the stack**.
2. `console.log("Hello!")` executes.
3. `greet()` completes â†’ **Execution Context for greet() is popped from the stack**.
4. `console.log("Done")` executes in the **Global Execution Context**.

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Execution Context** is where JavaScript code runs.
- The **Execution Context has two phases**: Memory Creation Phase and Code Execution Phase.
- Functions create **new Execution Contexts**, which are pushed onto the **Call Stack**.
- JavaScript manages execution using the **Call Stack**, which follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**.

## **Conclusion**
Understanding **Execution Context** and the **Call Stack** is essential for mastering JavaScript. These concepts help in debugging and optimizing performance. In the next section, we will explore **asynchronous JavaScript** and how it works with the event loop. ðŸš€
