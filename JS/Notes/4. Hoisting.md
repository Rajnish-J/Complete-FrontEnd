# JavaScript Hoisting: Understanding Execution Context and Variable Behavior

## **Introduction to Hoisting**
Hoisting is a unique behavior in JavaScript that allows variables and functions to be used **before they are declared** in the code. This is possible because JavaScript moves all variable and function declarations to the top of their scope **during the memory creation phase** of the execution context.

## **Hoisting in Action**
Consider the following JavaScript program:

```js
console.log(getName); // What will this print?
console.log(x); // What will this print?

var x = 7;
function getName() {
    console.log("Namaste JavaScript");
}
```
### **Expected Output:**
```
[Function: getName]  // Function is fully hoisted
undefined  // Variable x is hoisted but initialized with 'undefined'
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Function Declarations** (`getName`) are **fully hoisted** with their complete definition.
- **Variable Declarations** (`var x`) are hoisted but initialized with `undefined`.
- The program doesnâ€™t throw an error because JavaScript already allocates memory for both before execution starts.

## **Memory Creation Phase and Code Execution Phase**
### **1. Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting Occurs Here)**
- JavaScript scans the entire code and **allocates memory** for all variables and functions **before executing any line of code**.
- Variables declared with `var` are assigned `undefined`.
- Function declarations store the **entire function definition** in memory.

**Memory Allocation:**
| Variable/Function | Stored Value |
|------------------|-------------|
| `x` | `undefined` |
| `getName` | `Function definition` |

### **2. Code Execution Phase**
- JavaScript executes the program **line by line**.
- When `console.log(getName);` executes, it **prints the function definition**.
- When `console.log(x);` executes, it prints `undefined` since `x` is only **declared** but not **initialized** yet.
- When `x = 7;` runs, `undefined` is replaced with `7`.

## **Hoisting with `let` and `const`**
Unlike `var`, variables declared with `let` and `const` are **hoisted** but **not initialized**. Accessing them before declaration results in a **ReferenceError**.

```js
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 10;
```
### **Key Differences:**
| Variable Type | Hoisted? | Initial Value | Can be Accessed Before Declaration? |
|-------------|---------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| `var` | Yes | `undefined` | Yes (but gives `undefined`) |
| `let` | Yes | Not initialized | No (Throws ReferenceError) |
| `const` | Yes | Not initialized | No (Throws ReferenceError) |

## **Hoisting in Function Expressions and Arrow Functions**
Function **expressions** and **arrow functions** behave differently from function **declarations** when it comes to hoisting.

```js
console.log(getName2); // undefined
console.log(getName3); // ReferenceError

var getName2 = function() {
    console.log("Hello");
};

const getName3 = () => {
    console.log("Hi");
};
```
### **Explanation:**
- Function **expressions** (`var getName2`) are **hoisted but treated as a variable**, so it remains `undefined`.
- Arrow functions declared with `const` (`getName3`) are **not initialized** and throw a **ReferenceError**.

## **Understanding `undefined` vs `not defined`**
| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **undefined** | A variable exists in memory but has no assigned value yet. | `console.log(x); // undefined` if `var x;` was declared but not assigned a value. |
| **not defined** | The variable does not exist in memory at all. | `console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined` if `y` was never declared. |

## **How JavaScript Handles Hoisting in Execution Context**
### **Step 1: Global Execution Context (GEC) is Created**
When JavaScript starts executing a script, it first creates a **Global Execution Context (GEC)**, which consists of:
1. **Memory Creation Phase** (Allocates memory for variables and functions)
2. **Code Execution Phase** (Executes the program line by line)

### **Step 2: Call Stack and Execution Contexts**
Each time a function is invoked, a **new Execution Context** is created and pushed onto the **Call Stack**.

Example:
```js
function square(n) {
    return n * n;
}
var result = square(5);
```
**Call Stack Behavior:**
1. `GEC` is created and pushed onto the stack.
2. `square(5)` is called â†’ A new **Execution Context** for `square` is created and pushed onto the stack.
3. After execution, `square`'s **Execution Context is popped** off the stack.
4. Control returns to the **Global Execution Context**.

## **Recap and Key Takeaways**
- **Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope.**
- **Function declarations are fully hoisted**, while **variables declared with `var` are hoisted but assigned `undefined`.**
- **`let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized, causing ReferenceErrors if accessed before declaration.**
- **Function expressions and arrow functions behave like variables and do not get fully hoisted.**
- **Call Stack manages execution contexts, ensuring proper function execution.**

## **Conclusion**
Hoisting is a fundamental JavaScript concept that affects how variables and functions are interpreted before execution. Understanding how execution contexts and memory allocation work can help in debugging and writing efficient JavaScript code.
