# JavaScript Lexical Environment and Scope

## **Introduction**
Lexical Environment and Scope are fundamental concepts in JavaScript that define how variables and functions are accessed within different parts of a program. Understanding these concepts helps in managing memory efficiently and writing better code.

## **Lexical Environment**
### **Definition**
A Lexical Environment is a structure that holds an association between variable names and their values. Each function in JavaScript creates its own Lexical Environment, which is linked to its parent environment.

### **How Lexical Environment Works?**
When a function is defined, it remembers the scope in which it was created. This allows inner functions to access variables from their outer function even after the outer function has executed.

### **Example:**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am from outer scope";
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accessible due to Lexical Environment
    }
    
    return innerFunction;
}

const myFunction = outerFunction();
myFunction(); // Output: "I am from outer scope"
```

### **Explanation:**
- `innerFunction` is defined inside `outerFunction` and thus has access to `outerVariable`.
- Even after `outerFunction` is executed, `innerFunction` retains the reference to `outerVariable` due to Lexical Environment.

## **Execution Context & Memory Allocation**
### **Steps in Execution Context:**
1. **Memory Allocation Phase (Creation Phase):**
   - Variables are assigned `undefined`.
   - Functions are stored in memory.
   
2. **Execution Phase:**
   - Values are assigned to variables.
   - Functions are executed.

### **Example:**
```javascript
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
var myVar = 10;
console.log(myVar); // Output: 10
```

### **Explanation:**
- During memory allocation, `myVar` is assigned `undefined`.
- Later, `myVar` gets assigned `10`.

## **Scope in JavaScript**
Scope determines the accessibility of variables. There are three types of scope:

### **1. Global Scope:**
Variables declared outside any function belong to the global scope and are accessible everywhere.
```javascript
let globalVar = "I am global";
function testFunction() {
    console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
}
testFunction();
```

### **2. Function Scope:**
Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.
```javascript
function myFunction() {
    let localVar = "I am local";
    console.log(localVar);
}
myFunction();
// console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```

### **3. Block Scope (introduced in ES6 with `let` and `const`):**
Variables declared inside a block `{}` are not accessible outside that block.
```javascript
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I exist only inside this block";
    console.log(blockVar); // Works fine
}
// console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
```

## **Closures in JavaScript**
A closure is a function that retains access to its parent scope, even after the parent function has finished execution.

### **Example:**
```javascript
function counter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function () {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter(); // Output: 1
myCounter(); // Output: 2
```

### **Explanation:**
- `counter` returns an anonymous function that can access `count`.
- `myCounter` retains the reference to `count`, creating a closure.

## **Lexical Scope vs Dynamic Scope**
### **Lexical Scope (JavaScript uses this approach):**
Lexical Scope means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code.

```javascript
function outer() {
    let name = "John";
    function inner() {
        console.log(name); // Resolves `name` from outer function
    }
    inner();
}
outer();
```

### **Dynamic Scope (Not used in JavaScript):**
Dynamic Scope means that the scope is determined at runtime, depending on how functions are called. JavaScript does not support this.

## **Conclusion**
- Lexical Environment allows functions to retain references to variables from their parent scope.
- Scope defines the accessibility of variables.
- Closures leverage Lexical Environment to remember values even after the parent function executes.
- Understanding these concepts helps in debugging and writing efficient JavaScript code.
