# Recursion in Programming

## What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It is commonly used in problems involving hierarchical structures, backtracking, and divide-and-conquer strategies.

## Key Components of Recursion
1. **Base Case**: A condition that stops the recursion to prevent infinite loops.
2. **Recursive Case**: The function calls itself with a modified argument, bringing it closer to the base case.

## Example: Factorial Calculation
Factorial of a number `n` is defined as:

\[ n! = n \times (n-1)! \]

### Recursive Implementation
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:  # Base case
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive call

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

## How Recursion Works
Recursion follows the **Call Stack** principle:
1. `factorial(5)` calls `factorial(4)`
2. `factorial(4)` calls `factorial(3)`
3. `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)`
4. `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)`
5. `factorial(1)` returns `1` (base case)
6. Calls resolve in reverse order, calculating `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.

## Types of Recursion
1. **Direct Recursion**: A function calls itself directly.
   ```python
   def direct_recursion(n):
       if n == 0:
           return
       print(n)
       direct_recursion(n - 1)
   ```

2. **Indirect Recursion**: Function `A` calls function `B`, which then calls function `A`.
   ```python
   def funcA(n):
       if n <= 0:
           return
       print("A", n)
       funcB(n - 1)
   
   def funcB(n):
       if n <= 0:
           return
       print("B", n)
       funcA(n - 2)
   
   funcA(5)
   ```

## Common Problems Using Recursion
### 1. Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \]

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(6))  # Output: 8
```

### 2. Sum of Digits
```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n % 10 + sum_of_digits(n // 10)

print(sum_of_digits(1234))  # Output: 10
```

### 3. Reverse a String
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return ""
    return s[-1] + reverse_string(s[:-1])

print(reverse_string("hello"))  # Output: "olleh"
```

### 4. Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursion problem where you move `n` disks from a source peg to a destination peg using an auxiliary peg.

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {destination}")
        return
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, destination, auxiliary)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {destination}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, source, destination)

tower_of_hanoi(3, 'A', 'B', 'C')
```

## Recursion vs Iteration
| Feature       | Recursion | Iteration |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Memory Usage | High (stack calls) | Low (looping) |
| Readability  | Clear for problems like tree traversal | Better for performance |
| Performance  | Slower due to function calls | Faster as it avoids overhead |

## Tail Recursion Optimization
In **tail recursion**, the recursive call is the last operation in the function, allowing some compilers to optimize memory usage.

```python
def tail_recursive_factorial(n, accumulator=1):
    if n == 0:
        return accumulator
    return tail_recursive_factorial(n - 1, n * accumulator)

print(tail_recursive_factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

## When to Use Recursion
- Tree and graph traversal (e.g., Depth-First Search)
- Divide and conquer problems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Problems requiring backtracking (e.g., Sudoku Solver, Maze Problems)

## Summary
- Recursion is useful but should be used carefully to avoid stack overflow.
- Always define a base case to terminate recursion.
- Consider iterative alternatives for efficiency.

By understanding recursion, you can solve complex problems elegantly and efficiently!
