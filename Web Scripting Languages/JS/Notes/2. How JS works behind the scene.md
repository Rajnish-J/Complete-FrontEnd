# JavaScript Execution Context and How JavaScript Works

## **Introduction**
JavaScript is a **synchronous, single-threaded language**, meaning it executes one command at a time and in a specific order. Everything in JavaScript happens inside an **execution context**.

## **Execution Context**
The **execution context** is the environment where JavaScript code runs. You can imagine it as a **big container** that holds everything required for JavaScript execution.

### **Components of Execution Context**
The execution context consists of two main components:

### **1. Memory Component (Variable Environment)**
- This component stores **variables and functions** in key-value pairs.
- Example:
  ```js
  var a = 10; // 'a' is stored as a key with value 10
  function greet() {
      console.log("Hello!");
  } // 'greet' function is stored in memory
  ```
- The **variable environment** is the technical term for this memory component.

### **2. Code Component (Thread of Execution)**
- This is where JavaScript code is executed **one line at a time**.
- Also known as the **thread of execution**.
- The code component picks up instructions from memory and executes them sequentially.

## **JavaScript: Synchronous and Single-Threaded**
### **1. What is Single-Threaded?**
- JavaScript executes **one command at a time**.
- Example:
  ```js
  console.log("Step 1");
  console.log("Step 2");
  console.log("Step 3");
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Step 1
  Step 2
  Step 3
  ```
  - The code executes in a **top-to-bottom, left-to-right** manner.

### **2. What is Synchronous Execution?**
- JavaScript executes code **line by line, in order**.
- It **does not move to the next instruction until the current one is finished**.

Example:
```js
console.log("Hello");
alert("This will pause execution");
console.log("World");
```
- The **alert()** function stops execution until the user interacts with it.
- JavaScript waits for it to complete before moving to the next line.

## **Common Question: What About Asynchronous JavaScript?**
- You may have heard of **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**.
- JavaScript also supports **asynchronous execution** using:
  - Callbacks
  - Promises
  - Async/Await

We will cover **asynchronous JavaScript** in detail later.

## **Recap**
- **Execution Context** contains two parts:
  1. **Memory Component (Variable Environment)** â†’ Stores variables and functions.
  2. **Code Component (Thread of Execution)** â†’ Executes JavaScript code line by line.
- **JavaScript is Synchronous and Single-Threaded** â†’ Executes one command at a time in order.

## **Next Steps**
In the next section, we will:
- Walk through a real JavaScript program.
- See how the **execution context is created**.
- Understand how memory allocation and execution work in detail.
