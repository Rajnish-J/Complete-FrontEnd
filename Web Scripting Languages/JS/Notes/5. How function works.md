# JavaScript Function Invocation & Variable Environment

## **Introduction**
Functions play a crucial role in JavaScript, and understanding how they are invoked and how they interact with the variable environment is essential. In this guide, weâ€™ll break down how execution contexts are created, how function invocation works, and how variables behave within different scopes.

## **Function Invocation in JavaScript**
When a function is invoked, JavaScript creates a new **Execution Context** for it. Letâ€™s consider an example:

```js
function subscribe() {
    var x = 10;
    console.log("Inside subscribe function:", x);
}

console.log("Before function call");
subscribe();
console.log("After function call");
```

### **Execution Flow:**
1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created.
2. **Memory Allocation Phase:**
   - `subscribe` function is stored in memory.
   - `x` is allocated memory but remains `undefined` initially.
3. **Code Execution Phase:**
   - `console.log("Before function call")` executes.
   - `subscribe()` is invoked, creating a **new Execution Context**.
   - Inside `subscribe()`, `x = 10` replaces `undefined`.
   - `console.log("Inside subscribe function:", x)` executes.
   - The function execution finishes, and its Execution Context is removed.
   - Control returns to the **Global Execution Context**.
   - `console.log("After function call")` executes.

### **Expected Output:**
```
Before function call
Inside subscribe function: 10
After function call
```

## **Understanding Execution Context Creation**
Each **Execution Context** consists of two main components:
1. **Memory Component (Variable Environment)**: Stores variables and function declarations.
2. **Code Component (Thread of Execution)**: Executes the JavaScript code line by line.

When a function is invoked, **a new execution context is created** and added to the **Call Stack**.

```js
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
}

greet();
```
### **Call Stack Behavior:**
1. `GEC` is created and pushed onto the stack.
2. `greet()` is called â†’ A new **Execution Context** is created and pushed onto the stack.
3. After execution, `greet`'s **Execution Context is popped** off the stack.
4. Control returns to the **Global Execution Context**.

## **Memory Allocation for Variables**
JavaScript follows a **two-phase process** when executing a script:
1. **Memory Creation Phase:**
   - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
   - Function declarations are stored entirely in memory.

2. **Code Execution Phase:**
   - Variable assignments happen.
   - Function calls execute.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5
```

### **Expected Output:**
```
undefined
5
```

### **Explanation:**
- In the **Memory Creation Phase**, `a` is assigned `undefined`.
- During **Code Execution**, `a = 5` updates the value of `a`.

## **Function Invocation and Variable Scope**
Each function has its own **Execution Context**, meaning variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside it.

```js
function test() {
    var b = 20;
    console.log("Inside test function:", b);
}

test();
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

### **Explanation:**
- `b` exists **only within the test function**.
- Accessing `b` outside the function results in a **ReferenceError**.

## **Understanding `undefined` vs `not defined`**
| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **undefined** | A variable exists in memory but has no assigned value yet. | `console.log(x); // undefined` if `var x;` was declared but not assigned a value. |
| **not defined** | The variable does not exist in memory at all. | `console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined` if `y` was never declared. |

## **Recap and Key Takeaways**
- **Functions create new Execution Contexts** when invoked.
- **Execution Context consists of a Memory Component (Variable Environment) and a Code Component (Thread of Execution).**
- **JavaScript executes code in two phases:**
  1. **Memory Creation Phase** â†’ Allocates memory for variables and functions.
  2. **Code Execution Phase** â†’ Executes line by line.
- **Call Stack manages Execution Contexts** and ensures proper function execution.
- **Variables declared inside functions are not accessible outside their scope.**
- **`undefined` means a variable is declared but not assigned a value, whereas `not defined` means the variable does not exist.**

## **Conclusion**
Understanding **Function Invocation, Execution Context, and Variable Scope** is crucial for writing efficient JavaScript code. In the next section, we will dive deeper into **Closures and the Lexical Scope in JavaScript**. ðŸš€
